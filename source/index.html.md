# Introduction

Welcome, this is the documentation of the Awooing.moe API, from which you can get information from our website.. 
On the right, you can see examples in Shell, JS and PHP

The main API endpoint is `https://rest.awooing.moe/api/v1`

The CDN endpoint is `https://cdn.awooing.moe`

<aside class="warning">
As of 29/04/2020, the REST API isn't released yet. It is still in development as a part of the rewrite of the website.
</aside>

This is the rewrite of the v0 API, which had only 2 functions - random awoo image and discord avatar link for a council member.

As of now, this documentation still isn't complete. I will complete it soon though.
